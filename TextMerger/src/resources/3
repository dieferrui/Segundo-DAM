The cruelest pain
The wretched stain
I'm the castaway
The castaway
 
[Burn this world!] [Remembering]*
 
Through fire I row
For I need to cross an ocean of hellfire
A castaway with no voice left to
Scream in pain but my rage will reach you
 
My rage will reach you
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
My rage will reach you
