Purge the sunlight that I once knew
Burn this world
My pain and my deliverance
Burn!
This is the judge of your souls
I'll crucify you
Burn this world
I'll take you down
My rampage my voice
My only light

Lose all control of this hate
That my soul is remembering
Lose your control of this upside down world
Chaos, Inferno, Serenity
Your time is promised when nothing is foretold
Nothing imagined rise inside
