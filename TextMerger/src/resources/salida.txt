Hear me calling to you
Eons I've been waiting for you to
Find me and to hear me
Coming for
Purge the sunlight that I once knew
Burn this world
My pain and my deliverance
Burn!
This is the judge of your souls
I'll crucify you
Burn this world
I'll take you down
My rampage my voice
My only light

Lose all control of this hate
That my soul is remembering
Lose your control of this upside down world
Chaos, Inferno, Serenity
Your time is promised when nothing is foretold
Nothing imagined rise inside
The cruelest pain
The wretched stain
I'm the castaway
The castaway
 
[Burn this world!] [Remembering]*
 
Through fire I row
For I need to cross an ocean of hellfire
A castaway with no voice left to
Scream in pain but my rage will reach you
 
My rage will reach you
Hear me calling
Hear me calling
My rage will reach you
